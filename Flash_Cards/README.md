# Japanese Flash Cards

A Python GUI application to help learn Japanese vocabulary using flash cards.  
The app displays a Japanese word along with its romaji, then flips after 3 seconds to reveal the English translation.  
Users can mark words they already know, and the program automatically saves progress to a file so you only study the words you haven’t mastered yet.
